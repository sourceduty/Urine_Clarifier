To create a chemical compound that could theoretically remove contaminants from human urine in emergency survival scenarios, we would aim for a substance that can target and neutralize or separate harmful components, such as bacteria, viruses, salts, and organic waste products, while preserving water for safe consumption. One approach could be to design a multifunctional polymer that can adsorb and neutralize contaminants.

Let's conceptualize a polymer made of three key components:

1. **Antimicrobial Groups**: To neutralize harmful microorganisms, we could incorporate quaternary ammonium groups, known for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.
2. **Ion-Exchange Moieties**: To remove excess salts, ion-exchange groups such as sulfonate (for cation exchange) and quaternary ammonium (for anion exchange) could be integrated.
3. **Hydrophilic Backbone**: To ensure good solubility in water and facilitate interaction with contaminants, the polymer backbone should be hydrophilic. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) segments could be used for this purpose.

Here is a simplified representation of this polymer in plain text code block format:

```
Polymer Backbone: -[PEG]-[PEG]-[PEG]-
  |
  +-- Antimicrobial Group: -N+(CH3)3
  |
  +-- Cation Exchange Group: -SO3-
  |
  +-- Anion Exchange Group: -N+(CH3)3
```

In this conceptual design:

- `-[PEG]-` represents segments of the polyethylene glycol, providing water solubility and flexibility.
- `-N+(CH3)3` represents quaternary ammonium groups serving both as antimicrobial agents and anion exchangers.
- `-SO3-` represents sulfonate groups for cation exchange.

This hypothetical polymer would theoretically bind to, neutralize, or remove contaminants through different mechanisms: microbial inactivation by quaternary ammonium groups, ion exchange for salt removal, and possibly adsorption of organic molecules onto the polymer structure.

Please note, this is a conceptual design and such a compound would require extensive research and testing for efficacy, safety, and environmental impact before any practical application.
